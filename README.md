# biblio v1.0
Command-line bibliography creator and editor.

Biblio is a bibliography creator and editor that easily runs in the terminal.
The utility of this program over others is that it saves each bibliography as its own files, allowing you to name and keep track of each list of sources accordingly.
All style guides have been checked for accuracy.
The program currently supports such citations styles as:
 * MLA
 * APA
 * Chicago
each available to use in three different formats:
 * Website
 * Book
 * Article
Terminals running this program require the ability to identify ANSI/VT100 escape codes, as they are used to format text throughout.
